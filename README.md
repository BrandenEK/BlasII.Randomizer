## Useful Info
- Currently works with both version 1.0.5 and 1.1.0
- In order to avoid softlocks, it is recommended to use the Save & Quit mod
- Pressing 'F8' will display a list of your current settings

---

## Gameplay Differences

- All regions of the game are unlocked from the beginning, though you will still need movement items to reach them
- The door to Crimson Rains will be unlocked after obtaining a certain number of keys, specified in your settings
- Weapon memories can be purchased from the beginning, the lance is no longer necessary
- The map screen will display the number of items collected
- All tutorials and most cutscenes have been automatically skipped
